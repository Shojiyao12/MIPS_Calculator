## Quickstart Guide
1. Copy the Calculator.asm file from this repository.
2. Open this file using an IDE, like MARS v.4.5, which is also found within this repository.
3. Run the Calculator.asm file
   - The program should automatically prompt you to enter an expression (i.e. 5+5), then display what you entered (5+5), the postfix of that expression (5 5 +), and the final result (10).

## Core Concept
- Introduction to Computer Organization and Machine-level Programming
- Introduction to Assembly Languages
